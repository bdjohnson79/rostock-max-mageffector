=======================

Magnetic effector and arms for Rostock Max v1 printer

Inspired by designs from seemecnc forum users xnaron (the original magarm
developer) and flateric (who keyed me to the Traxxas ball studs)

Designed for an e3d version 5 hotend.  Due to a small error on my part, the
groovemount needs to be on the bottom side of the effector.

What you need:
1) 0.375" OD carbon fiber rods - 6x - length at your discretion, as long as all
6 are identical

2) Traxxas ball studs (part number 4933) - they come on 4 packs.  You'll need 3
packages.

3) These parts - 1 effector, 3 cheapskate adapters, 12 rod ends, 1 assembly jig.

4) 0.25" spacers for #6 screws - 6x

5) 6-32 1.5" SHCS - 6x

6) 3/8 diameter x 3/8 length rare-earth magnets.  I think mine were N62
strength.


Tools:
Thread taps - M5 and 6-32
Metric allen key (2.5mm) for ball studs
Standard allen key (7/64) for SHCS

Printing:
1) Material: not PLA - these are close to your hot end.  I did ABS.

2) Print setup: I did 0.2mm layers and 50% infill for the effector and
cheapskate adapters.  The rod ends, just print solid.  They're small enough that
infill is irrelevant.

Assembly:

1) Tap the M5 holes through the effector and cheapskate adapters, then drive the
ball studs.  Leave enough clearance that a rod end can be completely vertical
without hitting the effector.

2) Use two of the cheapskate adapters plus the assembly jig to ensure all of
your arms are exactly identical in length.  If not, you'll have a hard time
getting good prints.

3) Tap your cheapskates for the #6 screws used for the end stops.  Install the
new parts, and proceed to recalibration.  You'll need to adjust your delta arm
length parameter and printer radius parameter in your firmware.
